# Terminal Config

## Oh My ZSH
I use oh my zsh for highlighting with a theme. 

Under the .zshrc file insert: ZSH_THEME="eastwood"

## TMUX
Currently my tmux config consists of just the mouse on setting to easily switch between panes.
This can be done via the TMUX commands: `CTRL + B` `:` then enter `set -g mouse on`

Selecting text to copy and paste can be done with the `fn`/`option` key on mac or shift on linux.
To stop the selection from  highlighting another pane use the toggle option zoom: `CTRL + B` `z`.
